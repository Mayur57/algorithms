A repository for my implementations of frequently used data structures, essential algorithms, and LeetCode solutions solved as practice.

Most of the algorithms are implemented in C++, though there might be some LeetCode solutions in Java (for strings and stuff).

The solution files are named akin to semantic versioning for easy searchability.
- E-XXXX => Easy
- M-XXXX => Medium
- H-XXXX => Hard
- DSXX => Data Structure Core

**Examples:** `E-0065` -> `Problem #65` with difficulty level of `EASY`

If you have a better/faster/more verbose approach to any of the abovementioned things or find a mistake, please consider opening a pull request with your code/fix!
