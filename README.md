A repository for my implementations of frequently used data structures, essential algorithms, and LeetCode solutions solved as practice.

Most of the algorithms are implemented in C++, though there might be some LeetCode solutions in Java (for strings and stuff).

If you have a better/faster/more verbose approach to any of the abovementioned things, please consider opening a pull request with your code!
